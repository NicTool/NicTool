    * SQL: added record types: NAPTR, SSHFP, RRSIG, NSEC
    * corrected zone count in export log entries

2.12    2012.01.04

    * added syntax testing for modules
    * exports were including records from deleted zones (reported by R. Ross)
      added the nt_zone.deleted=0 condition to the zone record export query

    * added 2 more modules to install_deps.pl

2.11    2011.11.27

    * nt_export.pl will catch signals and exit gracefully
    * automatically clean up the many "success, 0 changed zones" entries in
      nt_nameserver_export_log
    * added valid wildcard record tests
    * added wildcard and SRV exceptions to valid_label

    * consolidated character verification logic into get_invalid_chars
    * moved tests out of new_or_edit_basic_verify into _valid_(MX,NS,A,etc)
      subs, making it easier for programmers to follow the flow of code
    * require all domain labels to end with a letter or digit
    * require (nearly) all domain labels to start with a letter
    * Added get_record_type to the API (see NicToolClient changes for why)
    * SQL: replaced nt_zone_record.type with nt_zone_record.type_id, which
      references resource_record_type.id. While this does make some queries
      slightly more complex, it greatly simplifies adding new RR types.
    * SQL: foreign key constraints are defined but not enabled by default.
      The test suite passes with them enabled. You must be using the InnoDB
      engine for FKC to work. InnoDB is the default engine in MySQL 5.5+
    * renamed SQL import files. With foreign key constraints, order matters.


2.10    2011.11.21  - mps

    * added NicToolServer::Zone::valid_label (RFC validation of domain name)
    * added NicToolServer::valid_ttl, and removed 6 duplicated instances
    * deleted unused NicToolServer::valid_hostname
    * consolidated duplicated definitions of _error into NicToolServer::error
    * added RFC 2181 domain name length restrictions
    * added IPv6 address expansion (from djbdnsRecordBuilder)
    * SQL: moved nt_nameserver_export_procstatus.status to
        nt_nameserver.export_status and dropped nt_nameserver_export_procstatus
    * SPF record support (in addition to TXT SPF records)
    * beefed up bin/nt_install_deps.pl.
    * SQL: added sql/upgrade.pl It logs into a NicTool database, determines
       which updates are required, and runs them.
    * SQL: added resource_record_types table. IDs are the IETF record type
      number and the name is the IETF record type. Using a related table moves
      the data out of the database schema (ENUM(blah,blah)) and into rows,
      where it belongs. It also means adding new record types won't require
      altering db tables.
    * if nt_export.pl was not provided a nsid, shows a list of active NSs
      before asking for a selection.
    * added NicToolServer::Export::BIND. Tested with BIND 9.6
    * SQL: renamed nt_nameserver.export_format='djb' -> 'tinydns'
    * SQL: added nt_zone_record.timestamp field. See the timestamp description
      on the tinydns-data page. Allows start/stop times for records.
    * added location support to database and tinydns exports. See
      https://www.tnpi.net/support/forums/index.php/topic,1004.0.html
    * added RFC 2181 tests. CNAME records cannot coexist with any other record
      type (except DNSSEC). NS and MX must not point to a CNAME.
    * SQL: added record types to database: DS, DNSKEY, KEY (not used yet)
    * added addserver and zone2nic in api/contrib (from Adrian)
    * do not replace : chars in record addresses. No longer necessary because
      export routines handle encoding of : during export.
    * subclassed the tinydns portions of NTS::Export into NTS::Export::tinydns
    * added support for exporting nsid=0 (all nameservers). Exports every
      zone, regardless of NS preference. Useful for virtual nameservers and
      the tinydns multiip patch.
    * ripped out all the https support from NicTool (server, client, API)
        Approximately 0% of installs use this feature. Anyone inclined to use
        it would likely use stunnel or ssh -L instead.
    * ripped out SSL certificate management (great idea, but unused)
    * SQL: Fixed the data model for zone nameservers. Replaced the abhorrent
      nt_zone.ns0..ns9 columns with the table nt_zone_nameservers.
      * there's no limit on how many nameservers a zone can publish to
      * queries are much simpler
      * deleted unpack_nameservers (no longer necessary)
      * added set_zone_nameservers
      * now we can run a simple, inexpensive query to determine if any
        zones that publish to a given NS have modification dates greater
        than the last successful export. Yah.
      * I broke the old nt_export_djb.c program. Boo. Any c++ programmers want
        to help? Read the TODO file in sys/djb and send a patch.
    * SQL: renamed nt_zone.output_format to export_format
    * SQL: converted deleted database fields from enum to tinyint(1)
      (enums are evil. Their contents are strings. Having to quote numeric
      values in every query has ALWAYS irritated me about NicTool. ENUM is
      MySQL proprietary, and they often don't behave as expected).
    * SQL: added nt_nameserver.export_serials
      (controls export of serial nums for tinydns export).
    * removed the quotes from many integers. Someone wasn't thinking...
    * ripped out nt_nameserver.service_type
    * removed all summary code (unused)

2.09    2011.10

    * added nt_options database table (and db_version value). Expect the
      contents of nictoolserver.conf and nictoolclient.conf to be here.

2.08    2010.03

    * added support for encrypted passwords in nt_user table
        see http://www.tnpi.net/support/forums/index.php/topic,902.0.html
      NOTICE: this version requires updating the database:
         $ mysql -u nictool -p nictool < sql/upgrade/update_v2_08.sql
    * Added file existence test before comparing for differences in
      nt_export_djb.pl
    * Updated the IPv6 implementation to choose between AAAA records with and
      without auto created PTR records. Lines prefixed with a 6 will have
      both an AAAA and a PTR record created. Those prefixed with a 3 will only
      have an AAAA record created.
    * Fixed a bug in Zone/Record/Sanity that allowed : character to be allowed
      when it shouldn't have been. This was causing tests to fail.
    * Restrictions on passwords were imposed but the test weren't updated. Fixed.

2.07     2008.09

    * Updated the export routine to djbdns so it supports IPv6 adresses
    * Add the option to add IPv6 AAAA addresses checked by Net::IP
    * fixed a bug that prevented Advanced Search feature from working
    * removed 28 lines of redundant code (thanks, maxv)

2.06     2007.10

    * fixed a bug in nt_export_djb.pl ($UID)
        (https://www.tnpi.net/support/forums/index.php/topic,821.0.html)
    * sort the zone records as signed integers (so reverse zone records are
       sorted correctly) - thanks Patrick Woo at telus
    * sort the zones as signed integers if group name has "reverse" in it
    * added additional user and password validity checks
       - max pass length of 15 chars
       - max user length of 50 chars
       - increased min password length to 6 chars
       - password cannot be same as username
       - password cannot contain the username
    * removed a bunch of code duplication in User/Sanity.pm by abstracting
      the user and password tests into their own subroutines
    * Changed the hard coded paging limit from 100 to 255 and noted the
      limit in the API docs per this notice:
        https://www.tnpi.net/support/forums/index.php/topic,800.0.html
    * nt_export_djb.pl fixes:
       - export always reported failure if rsync was not being used.
       - disabled some superfluous db logging that is not used.
       - nicer formatting of the "export status" message

2.05     2007.02

NOTICE: this version requires updating your SQL tables! Something like this should work:
     mysql -u nictool -p nictool < sql/upgrade/update_v2_05.sql

    * abstracted NicToolServer::Zone::Record::Sanity::new_or_edit_basic_verify
      into a suite of functions instead of one really big long nasty hard to read and poorly documented one
    * nt_export_djb updates to support SRV records
    * db_mysql.h
          o ZONE_QUERY_FORMAT shortened from 716 to 509 characters
          o added ZR_PRIORITY
          o added ZR_OTHER
    * nameserver/install.pl, rewrote, prompts for all required values with
      reasonable defaults. Setting up a nameserver export process is now much easier.
    * NicToolServer::Zone::get_zone_records: patch from slink, see forum thread
    * nt_export_djb.pl - provides better error messages if your ns export isn't set up right
    * bin/install_deps.sh - tries to install perl modules NicTool requires


2.04     2007.01

    - added "use Apache2::SOAP to nictoolserver.conf (mps)
    - djbdns/nameserver/install.pl updates (rl)

2.03    2005.04

    - NicToolServer/Zone/Record/Sanity.pm - allow / character in TXT records (for SPF)
    - NicToolServer/Zone/Record/Sanity.pm - replace any : characters in TXT records with \072 since : is a field delimiter in tinydns data files.

2.02    2004.10

    - NicToolServer/Response.pm - added mod_perl 2 check and use content_type instead of send_http_header if mod_perl 2.

2.01    2004.09

    - Added Copyright and Affero GPL license text to all source files
    - Added files LICENSE & COPYING
    - Updated files to reflect version 2.01
    - sys/djb - make clean now cleans up nameserver/sample/nt_export_djb*
    - consistent password among the variety of config files, now you can grep for it and change it everywhere at once.
    - Added support for TXT records, now you can set up SPF records for email

2.00    2002.02
    -Protocol version is now specified via the "nt_protocol_version" parameter.  This is an optional parameter.  If specified NicToolServer will require that the version string is allowed
    -Protocol version changed to 1.0.  Only this version is supported in NicToolServer version 2.00.
    -Permissions
        Entirely new permissions system.
        The affected API functions are:
        new_user, edit_user,get_user, new_group,edit_group,get_group
        Nearly all actual function calls are affected, because certain actions may
        not be allowed depending on a user's permissions.
    -Delegation
        Zones and Zone Records can be delegated to sub groups with a certain set
        of permissions.  (Affected API functions : delegate_zones,delegate_zone_records,edit_zone_delegation,edit_zone_record_delegation,delete_zone_delegation,delete_zone_record_delegation, get_delegated_zones,get_delegated_zone_records,get_zone_delegates,get_zone_record_delegates).

    -Usable Nameservers
        Each Group now contains a list of Nameserver objects which are in effect delegated to the Group.  Zones within the Group (and subgroups of the Group) can be published to any of these Nameservers.
    -API changes:
        get_user - 'nt_user_id' now only parameter
        save_user - DEPRECATED (see new_user and edit_user)
        new_user  - creates new user (params 'nt_group_id','username','email' required)

        save_group - DEPRECATED (see new_group edit_group)
        new_group - creates new group (params 'nt_group_id' 'name' required.  can have 'usable_nameservers' list of nameserver ids.)
        edit_group- param nt_group_id required (can have usable_nameservers)
        delete_group - only 'nt_group_id' parameter  reqd.

        save_zone - DEPRECATED (see new_zone edit_zone)
        new_zone  - 'nt_group_id' and 'zone' required (optional 'nameservers' list of nameservers to publish to)
        edit_zone - nt_zone_id required (optional 'nameservers' list of nameserver ids)
                  - parameter "deleted" = 0 means undelete a deleted zone

        get_zone_application_log REMOVED (it was never implemented but was enabled)

        save_zone_record - DEPRECATED (use new_zone_record and edit_zone_record)
        new_zone_record - 'nt_zone_id','name','ttl','address' are required
        edit_zone_record - only 'nt_zone_record_id' is required


        save_nameserver - DEPRECATED (use new_nameserver and edit_nameserver)
        new_nameserver - 'nt_nameserver_id','address','name','service_type','export_format' are required
        edit_nameserver - only 'nt_zone_record_id' is required

        get_group_zones - parameter "search_deleted" = '1' means only look for
            deleted zones with the specified properties
    -API additions
        error responses may contain 'error_desc' in addition to 'error_code' and 'error_msg', with a short description of the error.
